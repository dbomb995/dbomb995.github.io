##E-portfolio

###Professional Self-Assessment 
Completing the computer science program at SNHU has helped me learn a lot and become a better software engineer. Developing my e-portfolio has had me go through all of the work that I have completed during my time at SNHU and has shown me how far I have come. The program has helped me realize that I have a passion for programming and computer science in general. I have completed many projects during my time in college and have developed many skills to show for it. I have taken courses covering collaboration, where we collectively developed a java application that contained all of our favorite songs, we collaborated using git code management, using bitbucket. I have also taken many courses that helped to develop the required non-programming related skill it takes to become a successful software engineer, I have learned to create wireframes, code tests, prototypes and more during my time. Data Structures and algorithms have been covered in my coursework as well with topics such as linked lists, binary search trees and quick search algorithms being emphasized. I also have developed skills in both SQL databases and NoSQL databases in the form of MongoDB. This is only a brief description of some of the skills that I have developed during my time in college.

During My Final Project I updated 3 projects that I had completed throughout my computer science degree. The products were chosen to showcase my skills in three categories; Software Engineering, Data structures and algorithms, and Databases. 


####SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
My artifact to showcase my database abilities was my Final Project from CS340 Client/Server development. I created this artifact at the end of CS340. I chose to enhance this project for the first enhancement because it demonstrates my software engineering abilities. I successfully implemented the ability to dynamically load a database, the products usefulness now expands drastically because it can perform the CRUD operations with any database that is currently being hosted from the Mongo client the user is connected to.

####DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS
My artifact for this enhancement was my final Project from CS260 Data Structures and Algorithm’s. It was originally written in May of 2019, which lead to my first challenge I was unfamiliar with the code that I had written over a year ago. Luckily the code was well commented, and I was able to figure it out eventually. I included this project in my milestone because It displays knowledge of a wide variety of Data Structures and Algorithms. My planned enhancement was to display to the user which data structure was the fastest at a few tasks. The tasks I chose to display were loading data into the data structures, reading all the data contained inside of them, searching for a specific element contained inside the data structure, and removing an element from it.

####DATABASES
This project came from CS340 Client Server Development It was the final project for that course. I included this project into my final portfolio because I think that it showcases my ability to programmatically interact with databases. The Artifact was improved by my implementation of an HTML/CSS/JS user interface for performing CRUD operations on the database. The user interface consists of A Dropdown box for users to choose which operation to perform, and a text box to input their query. I performed all planned enhancements on this artifact.
